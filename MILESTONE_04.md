Short description for links above
---
Use of `.some()` : \
For each fav (favorite team) in the array, it checks if the _id of the favorite (converted to a string) is equal to teamId.
If at least one team in the favorites array matches the teamId, the HOF returns true, otherwise, it returns false.
Purpose:
The isFavorite function tells if a given team is one of the user's favorite teams.
The .some() function efficiently checks if the team is present in the favorites array.
\
Use of `.map()` : \
For each team in standings, it returns a new table row (`<tr>`) containing information about the team (like name, points, wins, losses, and draws).
Each row also includes logic to check if the team is one of the user's favorites using the isFavorite(team._id) function.
If the team is a favorite, the row is given the table-warning class to highlight it.

Description of research topics above with points
---

### React: 6 points 
#### Description of Usage: 
- Built a responsive and interactive frontend using React.
- Used functional components and React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom context hooks (`useAppContext`, `useFavoriteTeamsContext`) to manage global state.
- Created reusable components for forms (Login, Register, Season Selector), tables (Standings Table), and dynamic lists (Favorite Teams).
- Utilized React Router to manage client-side routing for pages like `/login`, `/register`, `/user`, `/standings`, and `/select-season`.
- Used conditional rendering to display feedback messages, loading spinners, and error alerts.
- Built reusable, clean, and maintainable code by separating components into pages, layouts, and contexts. 

### Bootstrap: 2 points 
#### Description of Usage: 
- Incorporated Bootstrap for consistent styling and layout.
- Used responsive classes to ensure that components are fully responsive on different screen sizes.
- Added custom-styled buttons, alert messages, and modals using Bootstrap classes like `btn`, `btn-primary`, `alert`, and `form-control`.
- Used Bootstrap icons to create a modern look and feel for form inputs, buttons, and interactive UI elements.
- Used Bootstrap's grid system (`col-md-4`, `row`, `container`) to create responsive layouts for the main page, forms, and user dashboards.

### Unit testing Mocha: 3 points
#### Description of Usage: 
- Wrote unit tests for backend API endpoints using Mocha and Chai.
- Created tests for all essential endpoints, including authentication (`/auth/login`, `/auth/register`), user favorites (`/user/users/favorites`, `/user/api/current-user`), data endpoints (`/matches`, `/season/select-season`), and error handling (like `404` routes).
- Used Supertest to simulate HTTP requests and ensure that server routes behave as expected.
- Verified that HTTP status codes, response bodies, and error messages were correct for both successful and error cases.
- Wrote before and after hooks to seed and clean up test databases for a clean testing environment.
- Used assertions to check if user authentication works correctly, database data is returned properly, and favorites are limited to three items.

### passport.js: 2 points 
#### Description of Usage:
- Implemented user authentication and session management using `Passport.js`.
- Created a local strategy for user login using Passport's `passport-local` module.
- Used Express session to manage session persistence, ensuring users remain logged in between requests.
- Built endpoints to support user login, logout, and session verification (`/auth/login`, `/auth/logout`, `/user/api/current-user`).
- Ensured that only authenticated users can access specific routes like `/user`, `/users/favorites`, and favorite team toggles.
- Protected routes using Passport middleware with `passport.authenticate('local')`.

### Football API: 2 points
#### Description of Usage:
- Used the Football Data API and CSV imports to fetch and load real-world football match data into the system.
- Built a **season selection system** where users can import CSV data from football-data.co.uk and view match results for a selected season and league.
- Used the `csv-parse` library to parse CSV files into JSON and **stored football matches and team information in MongoDB**.
- Created an API to dynamically fetch and display match results and team standings for selected seasons and stages (`/matches`, `/standings`).
- Created a fully interactive UI where users can explore match data, teams, and current standings in a clean, organized format.

Optional project notes
--- 
- Authentication Required: Key parts of the app (like user favorites) require the user to log in. Use the login and register forms.
- Team Favorites: Users can only select up to 3 favorite teams, and attempts to add more than 3 favorites will result in a validation error.
- Season and Stage Selection: Use proper season formatting (e.g., 2324) to load correct match data.
- When running the `app.test.mjs`, since the website is going to be running on the same port as the test file so it will give an error but it's going to pass all tests given if tested from the deployment server.
